function charis_check_health, inputcube
  compile_opt idl2

  ; this function takes the input cube, does some basic statistics and determines if it is:
  ; Goal: 1. a good science cube, 2. a good sky cube, 3. a bad science/sky cube (usually caused by bad extraction)
  ; For now: just check whether it is a good cube or a bad cube

  ; Is the cube good or bad?
  avgimage = mean(inputcube, dimension = 3)
  dist_circle, g, (size(avgimage, /dim))[0]
  bad = where(g le 60 and finite(avgimage) eq 0, nbad)

  if nbad gt 5 then begin
    healthflag = 'bad'
    return, healthflag
  endif else begin
    healthflag = 'good'
    ; return,healthflag

  ; Is the cube a science frame or a sky frame?
  ; TO DO!!!

  inner = where(g lt 20 and finite(avgimage) ne 0 and avgimage ne 0, ninner)
  outer = where(g gt 60 and finite(avgimage) ne 0 and avgimage ne 0, nouter)

  if mean(avgimage[inner]) gt 3 * mean(avgimage[outer]) then begin

  return, healthflag

  ; 2. take median of region beyond 60 pixels, take median of region within 20 pixels
  ; 3. if median within 20 pixels is > 10x higher then this is a science frame
